# IS101 Data Analysis Project

1. Clone Repository
2. Ensure dataset csv is present 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages
   - if virtual environment needed (i.e. Mac systems), create via command `python -m venv my_env`
   - if that does not work, run `pip install virtualenv`
4. Once packages are installed, to view a specific chart or graphic, run:
   - `python [filename].py`

The following files were used for final presentation and report: 

`3d_plot.py` - Life Expectancy (Years), Healthcare Expenditure per Capita (USD), Doctor-to-Patient Ratio

`scatter.py` - Life Expectancy (Years), Healthcare Expenditure per Capita (USD)
